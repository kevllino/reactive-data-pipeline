# reactive-data-pipeline

This repo is not complete, it only is a prototype of a more complex project involving data processing using AWS components (Lambda, Kinesis Stream, Kinesis Firehose) and (the Serverless framework)[https://serverless.com/]. It was written to prepare the lightning talk  at (Kats Conf 2)[http://www.katsconf.com/].
